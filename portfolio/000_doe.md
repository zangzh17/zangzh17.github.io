## Problem

Conventional DOE design workflows treat *design* and *fabrication* as two disjoint stages. This ignores proximity effect during lithography, resist blur and etch bias, causing performance gaps between simulated and manufactured parts.

## My Role

- Originated the concept and built the differentiable lithography simulator and physical optics simulator in **PyTorch**.
- Led a two‑person optical design and fabrication team and coordinated wafer runs with the Tsinghua NanoFab.
- Wrote 80% of the Optica paper.

## Approach

<div class="img-placeholder">[Pipeline overview schematic]</div>

The pipeline embeds a resist convolution, nonlinear exposure model inside an adjoint‑based phase optimizer:

- Started from random dose *D* (256 levels).
- Simulated aerial image → resist profile → etched height map.
- Forward diffracted field via Angular Spectrum Method / Fresnel diffraction.
- Loss: wavefront error + fabrication fidelity term.
- Gradients back‑prop through all stages; updated with Adam.

## Key Results

<div class="img-placeholder">[SEM micrograph vs. simulation overlay]</div>

- **4×** reduction in RMS phase error (λ/50 ➜ λ/200 at 1,550 nm).
- Diffractive efficiency ↑ 20% compared with baseline Gerchberg–Saxton design.
- First‑pass yield ↑ to 92% across a 20 mm wafer (n = 36 DOEs).

## Impact

The method halves the iteration cycle for NIR/VIS DOE prototypes from six weeks to three and is now being adopted by an automotive LiDAR startup to fabricate high‑efficiency beam shapers.

## Tech Stack

- **PyTorch** (autograd), CUDA kernels for resist convolution
- Python‑to‑GDS pipeline via `gdspy`
- SEM/confocal analysis in **OpenCV** + scikit‑image
